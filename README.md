Infrastructure diagram of the setup

## Here's a step-by-step approach, to reproduce this task

### Set 0: Getting Started: Assumptions and Prerequisites


**Prerequisites:**
- Functional knowledge of Linux, Git and GitHub, infrastructure as code has been assumed in this project assumed
- Ubuntu Linux 20.04 Focal Fossa LTS distribution was used for all the activities in the task.
- An AWS account with appropriate permissions to create resources like EKS, VPC, subnets, ECR, and RDS (MySQL) is required. Visit this link to [create an AWS account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/manage-acct-creating.html) if you don't already have an account.

### Step 1: Confirm Terraform is Installed Locally

The command to install Terraform may be slightly different, depending on your local operating system. Refer to the terraform installation documentation for system-specific requirements:Â [https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli).
Below is a command to install Terraform classic on an Ubuntu Linux machine.

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo snap install terraform --classic
```

To confirm the version of Terraform installed, run the command: `terraform --version`. This command will print the version of terraform installed.

### Step 2: Install and Configure AWS CLI to Authenticate to AWS.

Download and install the AWS CLI based on your operating system. Refer to this AWS documentation for device/operating system specific instruction: [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)

Below is a command to install it on Linux, distribution.

```bash
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
unzip awscliv2.zip
sudo ./aws/install
```

To confirm the version of terraform installed, run the command: `aws --version`. This command will print the version of AWS CLI that is installed.

```bash
aws --version
```

Optionally, you can run this command to remove the installation files:

```bash
rm -r aws awscliv2.zip
```

**Set Up AWS Environment Variables**

Set up AWS environment variables to help Terraform automatically pick up your AWS credentials.

Get your access keys and secret keys from AWS: follow this documenation for the detailed steps: [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/userguide/pstools-appendix-sign-up.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/userguide/pstools-appendix-sign-up.html)
Run the command on your terminal: **`aws configure`**.

```bash
aws configure
```

Set the following environment variables with your AWS credentials:
  - **`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`**: <AWS_Access_Key_ID>.
  - **`AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`**: <AWS_Secret_Access_Key>.
  - **`AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`**: <Preferred_AWS_region (e.g., **`us-east-1`**)>
  - **`Default output format`**: json

Run the following command to verify that your AWS CLI is configured correctly:

```bash
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

You should see information about the AWS account that your credentials are associated with.

### Step 3: Create your Terraform Configuration Files:

<details>
<summary>Option 1: Pull the repository from GitHub</summary>
<br>
  
Clone the terraform configuration repository from GitHub to your local device and change directory `cd` into this repository
  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/paschalogu/Terraform.git
cd Terraform
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Option 2: Create your own terraform configuration files</summary>
<br>
Make a Repository on your local device to hold Terraform codes, and change directory to this newly created repository.

```bash
mkdir Terraform
cd Terraform
```

Create **`main.tf`** for your main Terraform configuration, **`variables.tf`** to define variables (helpful for managing settings), and **`outputs.tf`** to define outputs (display useful information after running **`terraform apply`**).

```bash
touch main.tf variables.tf outputs.tf
```

The command above creates the three files at ones.

**Write your Terraform code in the Appropriate Files.**
Run the command `nano main.tf` and paste the code from [main.tf](main.tf) inside:
Repeat same steps for `variables.tf` and `outputs.tf` and paste the code from [variables.tf](variables.tf) and [outputs.tf](outputs.tf) respectively
</details>

### Step 4: Initialize, Plan, and Apply Terraform Configuration in your Project Directory:

To initialize the terraform project, run the command:

```bash
terraform init
```

Run `terraform plan` to see the list of changes that will be made on creation.

```bash
terraform plan
```

Apply your Terraform configuration to create AWS resources:

```bash
terraform apply
```

Terraform will display the changes to be made to your AWS infrastructure. Type **`yes`** and press Enter to confirm and apply the changes. To see the state of the infrastructure, run the command below `terraform state list`

```bash
terraform state list
```

Alternatively, you can use AWS CLI or the AWS Management Console to verify that the resources were created as expected.

To delete and clean up everything, run the destroy command below:

```bash
terraform destroy
```

### Step 5: Pushing the code to Source Code Management (GitHub)

Create a new repository on GitHub and push the existing repository from the command line

Initialize the repository for git.

On your project directory, run the below command to initialize git

```bash
git init
```

Create a `.gitignore` file by running the command `nano .gitignore`.
input the files you don't want to commit in this .gitignore file. This includes variable files and terraform state files. Any file added here will not be pushed to GitHub. Add below files to the .gitignore file

```bash
.git/
.terraform/
*.tfvars
terraform.tfstate
terraform.tfstate.backup
.terraform.lock.hcl
variables.tf
```

Proceed to add, commit , and push the code to Github.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Commit Message"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/<github_username>/<github_repo>.git
git push -u origin main
```
